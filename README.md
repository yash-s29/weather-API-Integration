##DESCRIPTION##

üìå Overview :

The Weather API Integration project is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches and displays real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to search for the current weather in any city or country around the world, offering a user-friendly interface with live updates on temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and more.

This project not only demonstrates the fundamentals of API integration but also showcases clean UI/UX design, asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX), and JSON data handling in a frontend environment. It is perfect for beginner-to-intermediate developers looking to understand how to consume public APIs in real-world applications.

üéØ Objectives

-- Integrate a third-party weather API (OpenWeatherMap).

-- Create a responsive and interactive UI for weather search.

-- Display real-time weather conditions including:

-- Temperature

-- Weather description

-- Humidity

-- Wind speed

-- Weather icon

-- Learn and apply key web development concepts: API calls, promises, async/await, DOM manipulation, and error handling.

üîß Tech Stack Used :

-- HTML5	Structure of the web application

-- CSS3	Styling and layout

-- JavaScript	Logic, API calls, and interactivity

-- OpenWeatherMap API	Provides live weather data in JSON format

üîç How It Works

//The user enters the name of a city in the input field.

//When the search is triggered, a fetch() request is sent to the OpenWeatherMap API using the city name and API key.

//The API returns a JSON object containing weather details.

//JavaScript extracts relevant data and dynamically updates the DOM to display:

- City Name

- Temperature (in Celsius)

- Humidity %

- Wind Speed (km/h or m/s)

- Weather Description

- Icon representing weather condition
